I realized just how powerful it would be to use multiple search engines to get the job done using search-engines-scraper, so I made some modifications which are fully backwards-compatible, but add significant functionality which may be valuable to people in similar situations.\n\n\nAdded the ability to use each Search Engine's Image Search capabilities, if they are available, and returning a list of direct URLS to images from those respective Search Engines.\n\n\nAdded the ability to specify a random useragent for scraping the search engines in an attempt to improve results\n\n\nAll functionality added is backwards compatible, meaning that no existing deployed workflows need modification with this update, while the image search and random useragent functionality is added\n\n\nUpdated the README to reflect the new functionality, as well as notes found with said functionality\n\n\nI have tested this on MacOS, Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10, using Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9, with all functionality performing as expected.",

        "Title": "Large language models encode clinical knowledge | Nature",
        "Description": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but the bar for clinical applications is high. Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and&nbsp;a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension,&nbsp;reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model1 (PaLM,&nbsp;a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA3, MedMCQA4, PubMedQA5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics6), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA&nbsp;(US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today‚Äôs models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications. Med-PaLM, a&nbsp;state-of-the-art large language model for medicine, is introduced and evaluated across several&nbsp;medical question answering tasks, demonstrating the promise of these models&nbsp;in this domain.",

        "Title": "Engineering Education: Research and Development in Curriculum and Instruction - John Heywood - Google Books",
        "Description": "A synthesis of nearly 2,000 articles to help make engineers better educators While a significant body of knowledge has evolved in the field of engineering education over the years, much of the published information has been restricted to scholarly journals and has not found a broad audience. This publication rectifies that situation by reviewing the findings of nearly 2,000 scholarly articles to help engineers become better educators, devise more effective curricula, and be more effective leaders and advocates in curriculum and research development. The author's first objective is to provide an illustrative review of research and development in engineering education since 1960. His second objective is, with the examples given, to encourage the practice of classroom assessment and research, and his third objective is to promote the idea of curriculum leadership. The publication is divided into four main parts:  Part I demonstrates how the underpinnings of education‚Äîhistory, philosophy, psychology, sociology‚Äîdetermine the aims and objectives of the curriculum and the curriculum's internal structure, which integrates assessment, content, teaching, and learning Part II focuses on the curriculum itself, considering such key issues as content organization, trends, and change. A chapter on interdisciplinary and integrated study and a chapter on project and problem-based models of curriculum are included Part III examines problem solving, creativity, and design Part IV delves into teaching, assessment, and evaluation, beginning with a chapter on the lecture, cooperative learning, and teamwork  The book ends with a brief, insightful forecast of the future of engineering education. Because this is a practical tool and reference for engineers, each chapter is self-contained and may be read independently of the others. Unlike other works in engineering education, which are generally intended for educational researchers, this publication is written not only for researchers in the field of engineering education, but also for all engineers who teach. All readers acquire a host of practical skills and knowledge in the fields of learning, philosophy, sociology, and history as they specifically apply to the process of engineering curriculum improvement and evaluation.",

        "Title": "Education and Society in Comparative Context - Eija Kimonen - Google Books",
        "Description": "\"What was the interrelationship between education and society during the twentieth century in the United States and India? What is the essence of the historical development of educational policies and social systems in these two countries? What philosophical views and developmental courses underlie their outdoor-oriented education? What are their aims of outdoor-oriented education? What procedures are connected with their outdoor-oriented education? These questions are examined in this unique volume.This book is divided into three parts. The first part creates a context for the comparison of the issues concerning education and society. The central point of departure used here regards education as being closely related to the totality of culture and human activity. The dialectic process between education and society is realized differently in accordance with the value objectives that provide the background for different societies. This comparative educational study uses a historico-hermeneutical approach. The second part analyzes the social systems and educational policies of the United States and India following their developmental trends and patterns. The nature of the relationship between education and society for each country is further brought into focus when it is interpreted from the perspective of the philosophical views, pedagogical aims, and procedures of twentieth-century outdoor-oriented education. The case studies provide an interesting insight into how changes in educational policy have been reflected in the every-day pedagogical procedures used in schools in the United States and India.The third part is an analysis and comparison of the phenomena previously presented that are related to education and society through the lenses suggested by sociological theories. It compares the dimensions of the interrelationship between education and society from the standpoint of outdoor-oriented education in the two countries during the twentieth century.This thought-provoking volume is intended for anybody interested in the interplay between education and society in all its complexity. It offers a fascinating journey into the past and present of the issues that have defined the development of education and society in the United States and India.\"",

        "Title": "Using AI to help organizations detect and report child sexual abuse material online",
        "Description": "Using the internet as a means to spread content that sexually exploits children is one of the worst abuses imaginable. That‚Äôs why since the early 2000s we‚Äôve been investing in technology, teams, and working closely with expert organizations, like the Internet Watch Foundation, to fight the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. There are also many other organizations of all sizes that are deeply committed to this fight‚Äîfrom civil society groups and specialist NGOs to other technology companies‚Äîand we all work to ensure we share the latest technological advancements.Today we‚Äôre introducing the next step in this fight: cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) that significantly advances our existing technologies to dramatically improve how service providers, NGOs, and other technology companies review this content at scale. By using deep neural networks for image processing, we can now assist reviewers sorting through many images by prioritizing the most likely CSAM content for review. While historical approaches to finding this content have relied exclusively on matching against hashes of known CSAM, the classifier keeps up with offenders by also targeting content that has not been previously confirmed as CSAM. Quick identification of new images means that children who are being sexually abused today are much more likely to be identified and protected from further abuse.We‚Äôre making this available for free to NGOs and industry partners via our Content Safety API, a toolkit to increase the capacity to review content in a way that requires fewer people to be exposed to it. Susie Hargreaves OBE, CEO, Internet Watch Foundation, said: &quot;We, and in particular our expert analysts, are excited about the development of an artificial intelligence tool which could help our human experts review material to an even greater scale and keep up with offenders, by targeting imagery that hasn‚Äôt previously been marked as illegal material. By sharing this new technology, the identification of images could be speeded up, which in turn could make the internet a safer place for both survivors and users.&quot;¬†We agree. This initiative will allow greatly improved speed in review processes of potential CSAM. We‚Äôve seen firsthand that this system can help a reviewer find and take action on 700% more CSAM content over the same time period.We&#39;ve been investing for years to tackle this challenge, developing technology to detect CSAM in ways that are precise and effective. We&#39;ve also been working across the industry and with NGOs to combat CSAM through our work in the Technology Coalition since 2006, with the WePROTECT Global Alliance, and through industry-wide initiatives aimed at sharing best practices and known hashes of CSAM.Identifying and fighting the spread of CSAM is an ongoing challenge, and governments, law enforcement, NGOs and industry all have a critically important role in protecting children from this horrific crime. While technology alone is not a panacea for this societal challenge, this work marks a big step forward in helping more organizations do this challenging work at scale. We will continue to invest in technology and organizations to help fight the perpetrators of CSAM and to keep our platforms and our users safe from this type of abhorrent content. We look forward to working alongside even more partners in the industry to help them do the same.¬†¬†If you‚Äôre interested in using the Content Safety API service at your organization, you can learn more and fill out the form on our website.",
